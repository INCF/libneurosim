## What is libneurosim?

libneurosim is a general library that provides interfaces for neuronal
simulators.

## Required external packages

libneurosim can be linked to MPI if it will be linked to a parallel
simulator.

## Where to find more information

Information about libneurosim can be found on the MUSIC home page at
the INCF Software Center:

    http://software.incf.org/software/libneurosim

## Submitting bug reports

Bug reports can be filed as issues on GitHub.

## Contributions welcome!

Currently, libneurosim is only supported by the
[NEST](http://github.com/nest/nest-simulator) simulator and only
provides the [Connection Generator
Interface](http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fninf.2014.00043).

This should change.

If you are developing algorithms that are usable by different
simulators, we would be happy if you'd send us a pull request.
